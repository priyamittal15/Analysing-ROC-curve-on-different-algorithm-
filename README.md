# Analysing-ROC-curve-on-different-algorithm-
creating ROC curve to analyses different algorithm on python
ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds.
Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds.
ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets.

So i used some algorithm and find out their ROc Curve to analyse that algorithm smoothly.
